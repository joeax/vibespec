## Architecture | Application | Application Design | Application Design | System Design
[Describes the high-level structure of the software system, including its components, modules, and their interactions.

### Entities

#### [Entity1]
- id: string
- name: string
- email: string (should contain a '@' symbol)
- phone: string
- address: string
- notes: string

#### [Entity2]
- id: string

### Relationships
- Entity1 has a one-to-many relationship with Entity2.

[This section can include diagrams, such as ER diagrams or UML class diagrams, to visually represent the data model.]

## Folder Structure
[Describes the folder structure of the project. Use a tree view (below) or nested list.]
```
.
├── src
│   ├── main.py
│   └── utils.py
├── tests
│   ├── test_main.py
│   └── test_utils.py
└── .env
```

## Setup
[List of project installation and setup instructions.]
- Install dependencies using X.
- Generate build scripts using Y.
- Create a `.env` file to store environment variables.

### Validation
- Validate the setup by running command `xyz` and ensure it completes without errors.

## UI
[Describes the user interface components, their layout, and interactions at a conceptual level. It can include wireframes, mockups, or detailed descriptions of UI elements.]

*[Note: This section should include detailed descriptions of UI elements, their behavior, and interactions at a conceptual level. And implementation details should be included in the Implementation section below.]*

### Layout
Description of the layout structure, including grid systems, spacing, and alignment.

### Pages
List of pages in the application, for web applications.

### Screens
List of screens in the application, for desktop or mobile applications.

## API
[Describes the application programming interfaces (APIs) used in the software system at a conceptual level. It can include details about RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, or any other type of API. For a frontend application, this help the backend that will be developed later. For a backend or full-stack application, this can steer how controllers/routes will be generated.]

### Endpoints
[List of API endpoints, including HTTP methods, paths, and descriptions. This can be formatted as a table or a list.]
- **GET /api/resource**: Retrieves a list of resources.
- **POST /api/resource**: Creates a new resource.
- **PUT /api/resource/{id}**: Updates an existing resource.
- **DELETE /api/resource/{id}**: Deletes a resource.

## Database
[Describes the database used in the software system, including the type of databases (e.g., SQL, NoSQL), the data model, and any relevant database technologies. This section may list out details about tables, collections, or schemas used in the database, when needed to guide the implementation. For a backend or full-stack solution, drives the implementation of database access code.]

*[Note: This section discusses the databases themselves. For the data design, refer to the Data section above.]*

## Implementation
[Describes the concrete implementation details, the "how" of the software system. It can include details about the specific code artifacts used in the implementation. **This section is primarily for developers who understand code. For non-developers, the sections above should provide enough information to understand the system's functionality without needing to direct the implementation details.**]
